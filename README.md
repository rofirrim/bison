# GNU Bison fork with Elkhound algorithm

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rofirrim/bison.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rofirrim/bison)

See https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~necula/Papers/elkhound_tr.pdf for the TR about this algorithm.

This fork aims at implementing this algorithm as an alternative of the existing
GLR algorithm of Bison. It does not pretend to replace because the existing GLR
implementation in Bison is very good.
